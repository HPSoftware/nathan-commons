<h2>Commons Modules</h2>

the commons module is an aggregator for different types of common functionality modules.

the first such module is commons-core, which contains the package com.hp.commons.core which includes
all common code that is standalone (i.e. requires no dependencies)

other such modules are commons-jenkins, which contains all the common code for jenkins plugins and
required dependencies and such.

all generic code should be in appropriate commons modules. the different products
should only include usages of common modules, and should have no general interfaces of its own.
if it can use some interface, so can other products.
